# Image reader
A simple tool to read text from images

## What?
Perhaps you have an annoying friend, who, instead of sending you a proper message sent you an image of the text saying "hi".
This tool not only reads the image but also copies it to your clipboard, just take a screenshot of the image and you're good to go!

## How?
The tool uses pytesseract to perform OCR of the screenshot you took, pyperclip copies it to the keyboard, I used a SO script to build the screenshot mechanism

## Why?
I was bored
